            I'm a 25-year-old graduate with a BSc in Marketing and Management, transitioning to a career in web development. My career journey spans the culinary and marketing worlds, where I developed my communication, teamwork, and organisation skills. Throughout my journey as a student and chef, I would spend my free time learning how to write code since I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it. Soon enough, this passion for technology has made me commit to becoming a Front-End Web Developer, building websites and learning new technologies.
